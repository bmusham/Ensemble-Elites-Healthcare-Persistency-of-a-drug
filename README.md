# Healthcare-Persistency-of-a-drug

Problem Description:
ABC Pharma is facing a significant challenge in understanding the persistency of drug usage as per physician prescriptions. The persistency of drug usage refers to the extent to which patients continue to take their prescribed medications over a specific period of time.
Currently, ABC Pharma Company relies on manual methods to track and analyze drug persistency. This involves reviewing patient records, conducting surveys, and relying on self-reporting, which can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack real-time insights.
To address this challenge, ABC Pharma Company has decided to approach an analytics company to automate the process of identifying drug persistency. The goal is to develop a data-driven solution that can accurately and efficiently track the usage of prescribed medications by patients, enabling ABC Pharma Company to gain valuable insights into the patterns of medication adherence.

Business Understanding:
By automating the identification of drug persistency, ABC Pharma Company aims to achieve several objectives. First, they want to understand the extent to which patients adhere to their prescribed medication regimens. This information will help them access the effectiveness of their drugs and identify any potential issues or barriers to adherence.
Second, ABC Pharma Company wants to identify patterns or trends in drug persistency across different patient groups, geographical locations, or disease conditions. These insights will enable them to tailor their marketing and educational efforts to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes.
Finally, automating the identification of drug persistency will allow ABC Pharma Company to gather real-time data, enabling them to proactively intervene when patients show signs of non-adherence. This can include targeted reminders, educational materials, or support programs to help patients stay on track with their prescribed medications.
In conclusion, by leveraging analytics and automation, ABC Pharma Company aims to enhance their understanding of drug persistency, improve patient adherence, and ultimately optimize the effectiveness and impact of their pharmaceutical products.
